# Starfinder

Procedural building tools and a general outline for the setting of the HUB System Starfinder campaign.

## The Hub System

This campaign is set in the far flung future of the Solar Planetary System (the place you live now.) The Solar System is completely unrecognizable in this epoch, even the name of the system has changed. Our sun is now known as Hub and we are the melting pot of the galaxy, colloquially named The Hub System (HUB.)

HUB is an [Participatory Economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics) [Anarchistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy) [Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation). More about the social and economic structures later, the important thing to know is that all the planets have been completely broken down for their materials and the entire system has been converted into a [Dyson Swarm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere#Dyson_swarm) made up of countless [O'Neill Cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder) and [Shellworlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellworld) which are held together by gravity and common defense interests.
