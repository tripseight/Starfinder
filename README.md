# Starfinder

Procedural building tools and a general outline for the setting of the HUB System Starfinder campaign.

## The Hub System

This campaign is set in the far flung future of the Solar Planetary System (the place you live now.) The Solar System is completely unrecognizable in this epoch, even the name of the system has changed. Our sun is now known as Hub and we are the melting pot of the galaxy, colloquially named The Hub System (HUB.)

HUB is an [Participatory Economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics) [Anarchistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy) [Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation). More about the social and economic structures later, the important thing to know is that all the planets have been completely broken down for their materials and the entire system has been converted into a [Dyson Swarm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere#Dyson_swarm) made up of countless [O'Neill Cylinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Neill_cylinder) and [Shellworlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellworld) which are held together by gravity and common defense interests.

HUB is the diplomatic center and military hegemony of the Local Stellar Structure ([LSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nearest_stars_and_brown_dwarfs)) made up of the [Prosaic, Anthropomorphic, and Exotic Races](https://github.com/tripseight/Starfinder/blob/main/races.json). This system was built during a three century long era known as the Age of Stellar Expansion when several of the prosaic societies began communicating and mutually developed space travel. First traveling at relativistic speeds and soon after discovering that faster than light travel was possible through the manipulation of gravity fields using nuclear fusion energy to unlock intra-quantum zero-point energy. Ships varying in size from single person craft to nomadic cities capable of housing whole societies were built using the QF Cube Engines that leveraged this new technologies.
